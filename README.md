This requires that Xcode is installed via the App store first. This is how I set it up on my machine, no specific reason.

Running bootstrap.sh should work. The best part is, since git is not included by default in OSX, you have to either:
* Copy everything manually
* Install homebrew, install git, then clone this repo. The bootstrap does this.

Maybe someone will find this useful apart from myself. Otherwise this is a nice thing to run and just have my machine ready to rumble
